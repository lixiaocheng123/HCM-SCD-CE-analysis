## Bayesian Models for Cost Effectiveness Analysis of a Prognostic Model for Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)

A predictive model for assessing risk of SCD among patients with HCM

* Using individual level data generate posterior distibution samples of probabilities, costs and health values using WinBUGS
* Simulate with a Markov model using the posterior samples as inputs
* Compare outcomes for risk groups in terms of cost-effectiveness

The model structure consists of a decision tree component and a Markov model component.
